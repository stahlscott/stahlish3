My first taste of programming came in middle school. Middle school for me coincided with the mid-90s, which were a bizarre time. _Hackers_ was released in 1995, and was a land of unimaginable coolness to us suburban, basement-dwelling, NES-obsessed weirdos. _The Net_ was also recently released, and Sandra Bullock was hacking herself some free pizzas. People were prefixing "cyber" in front of everything, and it actually seemed cool. (My first email address was _cyberspartacus_, referencing the aforementioned coolness of _cyber-_ mixed with a joke from _The Critic_ about Spartacus that I didn't really understand.) I learned from the pop culture of the day that floppy disks were a portable currency, and I imagined carrying around a set of programs in my pocket like a swiss army knife. _The Matrix_ and the actual coolness it would bring to the internet were an eternity away in 1999.

I had cajoled and convinced my parents to get a PC by ~1996, and we had that dangerous entrance to the internet known as AOL by ~1997. Now I had access to the world, and I imagined myself a Kevin Mitnick or a `Zer0 C0ol`. Of course I didn't know the first thing about what I was actually doing, but I had drive and a mischievous intuition. I quickly found my way into various chat rooms, which led to deeper chat rooms, which showed people passing around pirated films and programs, known as _warez_, which I had always pronounced like Juarez but I'm pretty sure in hindsight was probably like a merchant's _wares_, and magical little Windows 95 applications known as proggiez or progz.

Proggiez were typically written in Visual Basic, with names like AOHell, HaVoK, and Fate-X. They were the swiss army knife on a floppy disk I had always hoped for. Progz had many uses, very few of them legitimate. There were phishing tools to try to trick users into giving you their passwords or billing info, there were scrollers that would flood chatrooms with text or ASCII art, there were chatroom responder bots, there were mass spam mailers, and there were punters. Punters sent html strings that would overload the poorly-written HTML parser in the receiver's AOL instance and kick them offline. Being kicked offline in the 90s was a big deal. It took several minutes to open up AOL again and log back in, even with a top of the line 56k modem. Soon enough, progz would also come with anti-punters to neuter incoming punt strings. It was an arms race.

Once I stumbled upon this subculture, I became obsessed. I downloaded every prog I could find, evaluating them functionally and aesthetically. I was a prog snob. ([This](http://www.angelfire.com/ky/peschel/punters.html) is the closest thing I've found to a full list. Download at your own risk, though I'm doubtful any of the links even work. The names are definitely all real.) As 90s fashion itself evolved from neon to black, progz evolved from big ugly flame-graphic buttons with 30 second intro videos by guys named **XxHaCKeRxX** to minimal cold blues and purples by lowercase unicode guys named `dárk råïń` or whatever. I was in love with every piece, and I wanted to be a part of it.

Visual Basic 3.0 Enterprise seemed to be constantly available on warez sites, so I figured I'd give it a shot. I wanted to build badly enough that having no idea how to write code was not going to stop me. Like all warez, it came in 30-40 sequential RAR files that unzipped into a single install with a registration crack. I found myself a library of basic proggie functions that other people had written and distributed. All I had to do was deconstruct this bizarre language and figure out how to make things work. I spent hours every day during that summer of (I think 1998, maybe 1997) decrypting VB, figuring out how it worked, and translating it into building my own prog. I was designing my perfect UI, I was implementing & tweaking functions from the `.bas` library; I was building a prog of my own. I even put several encrypted passwords on it for higher access functions. Of course, no one but me ever used this application, but I was damn sure to build in 5 levels of security and ensured that I was the only one who would ever get full admin access. I was the admin of my own prog, and I would punt people with (some of) my own code, and I felt invulnerable. Did I almost get my family banned from AOL for life? Sure, several times. Did I end up talking my way out of it every time? Also yes.

All the learning I would do on this journey would set me on the course I ended up on later in life. With the right tools and access, I skated just above the line of getting in real trouble while learning what real computer programming was like. Fundamentally, I'm still doing the same thing today as I did with those VB building blocks: start with something someone smarter than me built, reverse-engineer it until I understand it, and go off on my own. I'm forever thankful for the access and freedom I had in those days.

Major shoutout to [this post by digital](http://www.digital5k.com/aol-progz-a-digital-throw-back-to-aol-1995/), the best reminiscence I've found of the progz scene. Be sure to check some of the links at the bottom, especially...

[This one, which is an awesome](http://justinakapaste.com) info dump of every piece of information from that era.

On the technical side, [this post](http://charlesleifer.com/blog/a-stroll-down-memory-lane-scripting-aol/) talks details about writing progz in Visual Basic. Seeing that old VB code and UI is bracing.
