I am a full-stack software engineer & web developer. I wasn't always. Here's how I got here.

### Skiplist, Software Developer // Cleveland OH, Full-time Remote

`05/2018 => present`

- Contracting/consulting, writing web & mobile applications.
- Developing in React, React-Native, Node, Python, Mongo, & more.
- Interacting directly with customers to build to their needs, from 4-week greenfield mobile projects to 1-2 year modernization rewrites.
- Building an engineering culture founded on democratic principles.

### OnShift, Software Developer // Cleveland OH

`06/2016 => 05/2018`

- Member of the core scheduling product team.
- Modernized an older Python codebase through new features, improved UI, automated testing, new tooling, & constant refactoring.

### Rochester Lumber Company, Vice President, Operations // Rochester, NY

`10/2009 => 02/2016`

- Directed daily and long-term strategy for company operations & IT.
- Supervised 4 branch managers toward goals of improved performance, profitability, & better team communication.
- Served as Retail Branch Manager, IT Manager, & Counter Sales during tenure.

### Education

I attained a B.S. in Wood Products Engineering from SUNY ESF at Syracuse. When I decided to switch from lumber to writing code in 2016, I attended and graduated from the Software Guild bootcamp in Akron, OH. And a fun fact since you read this far, I co-owned and operated a hot sauce business from 2012 to 2015. Ask me about it to unlock bonus points.
