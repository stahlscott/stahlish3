![developer with coffee](/img/coffeeshopsquare.png)

Full-stack software engineer & web developer. Teams are better than individuals. Learning is better than knowing. Done is better than perfect. Simple is better than complex.

Previously, I attained a B.S. in Wood Products Engineering from SUNY ESF at Syracuse. I worked in the lumber and building materials industry from 2007 to 2016. I co-owned and operated a hot sauce business from 2012 to 2015.
