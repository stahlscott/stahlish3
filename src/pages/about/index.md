I am a full-stack software engineer & web developer. I wasn't always. Here's how I got here.

### Education

I attained a B.S. in Wood Products Engineering from SUNY ESF at Syracuse. When I decided to switch from lumber to writing code in 2016, I attended and graduated from the Software Guild bootcamp in Akron, OH. And a fun fact since you read this far, I co-owned and operated a hot sauce business from 2012 to 2015. Ask me about it to unlock bonus points.
