I am a full-stack software engineer & web developer. I wasn't always. Here's how I got here.

### Skiplist

`may 2018 => present`

Contracting & consulting, writing web & mobile applications and data science projects for a variety of demanding customers.

### OnShift

`june 2016 => may 2018`

Worked on the core scheduling product. Modernized older Python codebase through new features, improved UI, automated testing, new tooling, & constant refactoring.

### Rochester Lumber Company

`october 2009 => february 2016`

Directed daily and long-term strategy for company operations and IT. Supervised 4 branch managers toward goals of improved performance, profitability, and better team communication. Also served as Counter Sales, IT Manager, Retail Branch Manager during tenure.

### Education

I attained a B.S. in Wood Products Engineering from SUNY ESF at Syracuse and graduated from the Software Guild bootcamp in Akron, OH when I switched from lumber to writing code. And a fun fact since you read this far, I co-owned and operated a hot sauce business from 2012 to 2015. Ask me about it to unlock bonus points.
