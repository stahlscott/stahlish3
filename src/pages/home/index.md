Full-stack software engineer & web developer.

- Teams are better than individuals.
- Asking is better than assuming.
- Simple is better than complex.

I've been lucky enough to work professionally with Python, ReactJS, React-Native, Node, Docker, SQL, and Mongo, among many others.

I'd love to connect and learn and work with new people. Contact me via any of the social links above.
